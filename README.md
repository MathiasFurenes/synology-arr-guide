# What is this?

This is my first github project. I want to share a .pdf file with documentation on how to install -arr apps on a Synology NAS device with a VPN.
Under you can read just a little snippet of my document. It spans over 96 pages, and goes into detail on how to get the best possible experience with this setup.
It also includes a TL;DR for the lazy ones, but just for how to isntall it. The configs you will have to read through, since it's so much important information there.
The TL;DR also assumes you actually know a little bit about the subject, as if you do not you should read the full length docs.
Please comment anything that would make it better. Things I should add, remove, change or other things. If you get stuck anywhere, you can always drop a comment with your problem I will try to get back to you.

Introduction
Before we start let’s figure out your needs. Do you want to download movies, tv shows, music, e-books, comics or adult videos? 
Most likely you want a combination of a lot of them. 
We also need to figure out whether you want it to be connected to a VPN. 
Here is a break-down of all the apps and their use-cases:

The apps I will cover in this guide

I would like to cover as many as possible, but I have not used or tried some of them myself. I host on Plex, so I use Overseer, and have not tried neither Jellyseer or Ombi. 
Even though I’m pretty sure Jellyseer is the exact same just for Jellyfin. But you should always read the official docs yourself. Anyway, the apps I will go over is:

•	GlueTUN
•	Prowlarr
•	Flaresolverr
•	Sonarr
•	Radarr
•	Lidarr
•	Overseer
•	Requestrr
•	qBitTorrent
